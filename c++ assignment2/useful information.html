                    <h1>Currency and Exchange</h1>
                    <p>The national currency of Ethiopia is the Ethiopian Birr (ETB), with an exchange of 21 to the US$  (April 2016). Birr may not be imported nor exported. We advise you to bring most of your funds in cash. US Dollars, Sterling or Euros are all accepted. Visitors may import an unlimited amount of foreign currency but they need to declare amounts exceeding 10 000 USD at the customs upon arrival. At the airport it can be very slow to exchange money but the various banks in Addis Ababa are good options.  US Dollars, Sterling or Euros should be clean and free from rips or marks. Travelers cheques issued either by Thomas Cook or American Express can also be changed at the airport, but they can be difficult to cash anywhere else. Outside of Addis Ababa, credit cards are not accepted in most establishments, so it’s better to carry enough cash to last for a few days.</p>
